# Clarification - DO NOT INSTALL - IN DEVELOPMENT

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/clarification`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clarification'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clarification

## Configuration

Configure the gem as you would normally.

```
  Clarification.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = 'a_big_secret_you_got_from_clarifai'
    config.end_points = [:food]
  end
```

This should also work nicely inside a rails initializer.

## Usage

```
client = Clarification::Client.new
response = client.request(some_public_url)
response[:food] #=> the sha-bling.
```

Each endpoint initialized will be called.  So this analyze action will call two separate API routes and will count as two uses of your key.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
